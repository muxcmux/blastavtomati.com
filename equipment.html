      <p>KAMP-01 Blow-moulding machine is a piece of equipment for the production of hollow volume articles from PVC, PE and PP with capacity from 5ml to 150ml. Its productivity is 300 items per hour when manufacturing 100ml bottles and it can be plugged in a standard 220 V wall socket, which makes it an exceptional performer and first in it's class.</p>
      <p>The machine's screw pack is driven by an asynchronous motor with a reduction gear transmission. The motor revolutions are being gauged, controlled and adjusted by a programmable control block. The drive is built on LENZ - Austria components. The control block is based on a programmable controller. The machine is operated from a control panel with sensor information available on an LCD display.</p>

      <p>There are options for needle-forming plus automatic cutting off of the technological waste and mandrill. The command panel, pneumatic controllers and information components are made by FESTO - Austria.</p>
      <p>KAMP-01 machine operates on a non-stop production cycle. The use of contemporary high tech components from renowned European companies secures reliability, flexibility and simplicity of the adjustments, control and operation of the machine. The machine achieves a lower then average cost of the manufactured items due to its low power consumption and high for its class productivity.</p>
